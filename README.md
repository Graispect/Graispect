## maha (mk) (((also known as graispect)))

i saw a post once that said *“create what you wish existed.”*  
i did. and i never looked back.

i build personal, privacy-minded apps with my own icons, my own filters,  
my own rules. all lowercase. pure black backgrounds. vt323 on purpose.  
retro aura. (the internet looked better before i existed.)

### **graispect**
a private, friends-only social app.  
no explore pages. no strangers. no algorithms.

just a mundane app — glimpses, moods, thoughts, tunes,  
maybe even silence. but for sure, safe circles.

built slowly. intentionally. with a lot of refusal.

### **mk’s cams** (by graispect)
an ios film camera with seeded filters and custom lenses.  
glitch overlays. disposable-camera feel.

every icon hand-drawn.  
every frame processed through my own pipeline.

### **to n from mk** (by graispect)
a letter-writing experience.

you answer cryptically.  
it writes what you couldn’t finish saying.

not a notes app.

built to explore **intention**, **tone**, and **structure**  
without saving your words or feeding algorithms.

letters are generated, felt, and released.

designed, written, and engineered end-to-end.

### **what i make**
- minimal interfaces  
- glitch aesthetics  
- custom procreate icons  
- film-camera filters & core image pipelines  
- quiet, privacy-first spaces
