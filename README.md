## maha (mk)

my name isn’t mk.  
it’s maha. mk is just the part of me that builds the things i wish existed, .
i saw post once that said *“create what you wish existed.”*  
i did. and i never looked back. i'll never look back.

my 9–5: software engineer.  
my 5–9: i design my gray views.

i build personal, privacy-minded apps with my own icons, my own filters,  
my own rules. all lowercase. pure black backgrounds. vt323 on purpose, retro aura. (the internet looked better before i existed and i wish i was there when dial-up existed.)

### graispect  
a private, friends-only social app.  
no explore pages. no strangers. no algorithms.  
just a mundane app, glimpses, moods, thoughts, tunes, maybe even silence, but for sure safe circles.  
built slowly, intentionally, and with a lot of refusal.

### mk’s cams (by graispect)  
an ios film camera with seeded filters, custom lenses,  
glitch overlays, and a disposable-camera feel.  
every icon hand-drawn, every frame processed through my own pipeline.

### what i make  
- minimal interfaces  
- glitch aesthetics  
- custom procreate icons  
- film-camera filters & core image pipelines  
- quiet, privacy-first spaces
