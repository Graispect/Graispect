## Hello,

# Graispect – iOS App (In Development)

A privacy-focused social networking app currently under development.  Features are DIFFERENT from the usual social networks applications and websites. This project reflects my design thinking, development skills, and need of an app to showcase my art, my poetry, and an app people can use on the daily without mind melting or doom scrolling.

## What I Worked On
- Designed the user interface using Figma
- Designed the icons using Procreate
- Built the app using SwiftUI in Xcode
- Created custom icons and interaction flows
- Came up with different ways people can share their creativity.
- Designed and deployed the app’s landing page (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

## Tools & Languages
- SwiftUI, Xcode  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Figma, Procreate

## Why It’s Private
This app is still in development and contains original UX concepts that I’d like to keep confidential until I release. No source code or full demo is available yet, unless I hand you my laptop & phone. 

## Peace,
Mk
